    "## HTML Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**The web is a constantly evolving entity. As we build more ambitious products or learn from our collective needs and mistakes, the industry will continually update the HTML specifications.\n",
    "Researching referencing documentation can be scary at first, but it's a primary skill for developers. Don't be afraid to practice technical searches. It's a skill that you will get better at with practice.\n",
    "Most importantly, don't feel like not knowing everything by heart means you can't be a developer. The greatest developers we know are constantly admitting what they don't know, finding the latest news, using the answer they found, and moving on.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML syntax\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>Hello World</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements, like our `p` tags above, won't be displayed in the browser. Instead,\n",
    "they affect how the content itself is displayed. Technologists might say that\n",
    "the tags \"affect how the content is rendered by the browser.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also alter any number of attributes inside of the opening tags. For\n",
    "example, the `a` element, which is used for links, has an `href` attribute to\n",
    "specify the destination address of the link. If we wanted to link to\n",
    "www.flatironschool.com, we could do so as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<a href=\"http://www.flatironschool.com\">Flatiron School</a>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would render as:\n",
    "\n",
    "[Flatiron School](http://www.flatironschool.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also nest elements inside of each other. To have a link displayed as a\n",
    "separate paragraph, we could nest an `a` element inside of a `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<p>This <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">link</a> will be a part of a separate paragraph.</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic HTML Document Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "All HTML documents begin with a \"doctype declaration\" tag, which tells our web\n",
    "browser which version of HTML to use. HTML is a language that is currently\n",
    "evolving &mdash; just like English. When we open \"Romeo and Juliet,\" our\n",
    "expectation is that the \"doctype\" is \"Elizabethan English.\" In the same way\n",
    "\"Elizabethan English\" has changed to a more modern form, HTML 1.0 was\n",
    "_essentially_ the same as modern HTML5 but had some tags we don't use any more\n",
    "and was lacking some tags we use often today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's not wrapping any content, our doctype declaration doesn't require a\n",
    "closing tag. To use HTML5, the current up-to-date version, we can simply\n",
    "declare `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we add an opening and closing `html` tag. This tells the web browser to\n",
    "interpret everything inside the tags as HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every HTML page is made up of two primary sections: a `head` and a `body`. The\n",
    "`head` element contains metadata about the HTML document and other information\n",
    "for the browser, while the `body` element contains the actual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <!-- metadata about the HTML document as a whole -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <!-- content of our page will be here! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common HTML Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already looked at some common HTML elements, such as `a` and `p`. Let's\n",
    "take a look at some more HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML gives us access to different header elements, ranging from `h1` to `h6`,\n",
    "with `h1` being the largest and `h6` being the smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>Dogs!</h1>\n",
    "<h3>Why Dogs are Great</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h6>Different Breeds</h6>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to changing how the text is displayed, search engines use headers\n",
    "to help determine what a web page is about. Remember, as Avi pointed out, when\n",
    "we provide _semantic_ markup, machines can infer the \"main points\" of a page. A\n",
    "well structured article will generally have its principal arguments bracketed\n",
    "by low-number header tags -- this very document does exactly that!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "We can embed images on our web pages using the `img` element. The `img` element\n",
    "doesn't have a closing tag. The `src` attribute tells the browser where to find\n",
    "the image. The `alt` attribute will be displayed if an image can't be loaded,\n",
    "and also describes the image to search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `alt` tag presents a moment to talk about an important principle behind Tim\n",
    "Berners-Lee's vision for the Web: it is _inclusive_. If you're using assistive\n",
    "technologies because you have a sight impairment, it's helpful to know what's\n",
    "being displayed. If you're in a remote community where internet access is\n",
    "expensive, you might choose to disable images and only pay to download those\n",
    "which you _absolutely need_. So while an `img` will inject an image and \"work,\"\n",
    "honoring the Web's vision for openness and inclusivity requires that we provide\n",
    "the `alt` tag as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<img src=\"URL_TO_IMAGE\" alt=\"Picture of a Dog\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other useful HTML elements are lists. We can make bulleted, or unordered\n",
    "lists, using opening and closing `ul` tags. Inside, we can nest an `li`, or\n",
    "\"list item\" element for each item on our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h5>My Favorite Things in No Particular Order</h5>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "    <li>Vinyl Records</li>\n",
    "    <li>Pickling</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would render as:\n",
    "\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>My Favorite Things in No Particular Order</h5>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "    <li>Vinyl Records</li>\n",
    "    <li>Pickling</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make a numbered, or ordered list, using an `ol` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h5>Top 5 Pizza Places in NYC</h5>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>DiFara Pizza</li>\n",

    "## HTML semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "When the W3C (the organization that oversees the specifications for HTML and\n",
    "CSS) started writing the specification for HTML5 they wanted to create new\n",
    "elements that would eliminate the need to label so many `div` elements. The\n",
    "goals were to make the code more readable for developers and more descriptive\n",
    "for browsers. It turned out that many developers were already using the same\n",
    "names to label their elements, such as `id=\"header\"`, `id=\"footer\"`, `id=\"nav\"`,\n",
    "`class=\"article\"`, etc. So HTML5 provided semantic elements that explicitly\n",
    "described those functions for developers to use instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We once used to have to identify a `div` as our header section.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"header\">...</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we use the `header` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<header></header>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we call these _semantic_ elements? Semantic elements are elements that\n",
    "we use when the content within the element all has the same related _meaning_.\n",
    "In our `header` example above, all the content we would put within the `header`\n",
    "element would relate to introductory content, such as titles or navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Demonstrate HTML5 Semantic Element Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a layout that uses `div` elements and convert it to use semantic\n",
    "elements instead. This is the markup we begin with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"wrapper\">\n",
    "  <div id=\"header\">\n",
    "     <div id=\"nav\">...</div>\n",

    "  </div>\n",
    "  <div id=\"aside\">...</div>\n",
    "  <div id=\"footer\">...</div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll replace each instance of a `div` with a semantic element that matches\n",
    "the type of content we want it to contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div class=\"wrapper\">\n",
    "  <header>\n",
    "     <nav>...</nav>\n",
    "  </header>\n",
    "  <main>\n",
    "    <section id=\"music\">\n",

    "  </main>\n",
    "  <aside>...</aside>\n",
    "  <footer>...</footer>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in cases where the content within the element is not semantically\n",
    "related or we have the need to create a generic box such as the `wrapper`, we\n",
    "can still use `div` elements as we please. As a developer, keep in mind that\n",
    "while these elements are intended for certain content, there are no hard rules\n",
    "about how to configure them. You should feel comfortable configuring them in any\n",
