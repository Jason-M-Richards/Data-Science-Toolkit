In some cases, identifying will be easy (e.g. if they are stored as strings), in other cases they are numeric and the fact that they are categorical is not always immediately apparent.  Note that this may not be trivial. A first thing you can do is use the `.describe()` function and `.info()`-function and get a better sense. `.describe()` will give you info on the data types (like strings, integers, etc), but even then continuous variables might have been imported as strings, so it's very important to really have a look at your data.\n",

This is because most machine learning algorithms use Euclidean distance between two data points in their computations. Because of that, making sure that features have similar scales is formally required there. Some algorithms even require features to be zero centric.\n",
