# Toolkit

The following repository contains all of the information I have gathered over my experience as a Data Scientist. I made my best attempts to organize and structure the notebooks to make them as easy to follow as possible. The goal is to empower anyone with code and instruction to start a deep dive into Data Science and see if it is something that interests you. 

For the working Data Scientist, it contains code that may provide a helping hand at opportune times.

If I am missing information, please let me know. I am happy to always study a new topic of interest on the subject.
