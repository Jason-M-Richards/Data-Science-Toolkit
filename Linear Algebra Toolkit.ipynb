    "## Systems of Linear Equations\n",
    "In mathematics, a system of linear equations (or linear system) is a collection of two or more linear equations involving the same set of variables. For example, look at following equations.\n",

    "- 2x- 2y + 4z = -2\n",
    "- -x + 0.5y - z = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a system of three equations in the three variables x, y, z. A solution to a linear system is an assignment of values to the variables such that all the equations are simultaneously satisfied. A solution to the system above is given by:\n",

    "- y = -8/3\n",

    "Let's say you go to a market and buy 2 apples and 1 banana. For this you end up paying 35 pence. If we denote apples by a and bananas by b, the relationship between bought items bought and price paid can be written down as an equation - let's call it Eq. A:\n",
