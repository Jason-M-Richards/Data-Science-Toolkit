    "#### Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is one of the most important statistical techniques for business applications. It’s a statistical methodology that helps estimate the strength and direction of the relationship between two (or more variables). Regression results show whether the relationship is valid or not. It also helps to _predict_ an unknown value based on the derived relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regression Analysis is a __parametric__ technique used to **predict** the value of an unknown target variable (or dependent variable) $y$ based on one or more of known input features (or independent variables, predictors), often denoted by $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Linearity**, one of the assumptions of this approach, suggests that the relationship between dependent and independent variable can be expressed as a straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, regression analysis helps us in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finding an **association** or relationship between certain phenomenons or variables\n",
    "* Identifying **which variables contribute** more towards the outcomes\n",
    "* **Prediction** of future observations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear regression is simply a manifestation of $$y=mx+c$$ or, alternatively $$y =  \\beta_0+ \\beta_1 x $$ So this is as complicated as our linear regression model gets. The equation here is the same one used to find a line in algebra, but in statistics, the actual data points don't actually lie on a line!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The real challenge for regression analysis is to fit a line, out of an infinite number of lines that best describes that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y}=\\hat m x+ \\hat{c}$$ or \n",
    "$$\\hat y =  \\hat \\beta_0+ \\hat \\beta_1 x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, you're using a \"hat\" notation which stands for the fact that we are working with **estimations**.\n",
    "- When trying to draw a \"best fit line\", you're **estimating** the most appropriate value possible for your intercept and your slope, hence $\\hat{c}$ /$ \\hat \\beta_0 $ and  $\\hat{m}$ /$ \\hat \\beta_1 $.\n",
    "- Next, when we use our line to predict new values $y$ given $x$, your estimate is an **approximation** based on our estimated parameter values. Hence we use $\\hat y $ instead of $y$. $\\hat y$ lies _ON_ your regression line, $y$ is the associated y-value for each of the blue diamonds in the plot below. The **error** or the **vertical offset** between the line and the actual observation values is denoted by the red vertical lines in the plot above. Mathematically, the vertical offset can be written as $\\mid \\hat y - y\\mid$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best-Fit Line Ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we calculate the best-fit line, we have to make sure that we have calculated the following measures for variables X and Y:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mean of the X $(\\bar{X})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The mean of the Y $(\\bar{Y})$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The standard deviation of the X values $(S_X)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The standard deviation of the y values $(S_Y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The correlation between X and Y ( often denoted by the Greek letter \"Rho\" or $\\rho$ - Pearson Correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Slope  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the above ingredients in hand, we can calculate the slope (shown as $b$ below) of the best-fit line, using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat m = \\rho \\frac{S_Y}{S_X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula is also known as the **least squares method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[You can visit this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression#Fitting_the_regression_line) to get take a look into the maths behind derivation of this formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope of the best-fit line can be a negative number following a negative correlation.  For example, if an increase in police officers is related to a decrease in the number of crimes in a linear fashion, the correlation and hence the slope of the best-fitting line in this particular setting is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Intercept\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we have the slope value (\\hat m), we can put it back into our formula $(\\hat y = \\hat m x+ \\hat c)$ to calculate intercept. The idea is that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{Y} = \\hat c + \\hat m \\bar{X}$$\n",
    "$$ \\hat c = \\bar{Y} - \\hat m\\bar{X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$ are the mean values for variables X and Y.  So, in order to calculate the $\\hat y$-intercept of the best-fit line, we start by finding the slope of the best-fit line using the above formula. Then to find the $\\hat y$-intercept, we multiply slope value by mean of x and subtract the result from mean of y. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Predicting from the model\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, when you have a regression line with defined parameters slope and intercept as calculated above, you can easily predict the $\\hat{y}$ (target) value for a new $x$ (feature) value using the estimated parameter values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\hat mx + \\hat c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the difference between y and $\\hat{y}$ is that $\\hat{y}$ is the value predicted by the fitted model, whereas $y$ carries actual values of the variable (called the truth values) that were used to calculate the best fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "> The linearity assumptions requires that there is a **linear relationship** between the response variable (Y) and predictor (X). Linear means that the change in Y by 1-unit change in X, is constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we try to fit a linear model to a non-linear data set, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) will fail to capture the trend mathematically, resulting in an inaccurate relationship. This will also result in erroneous predictions on an unseen data set.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots \n",
    "\n",
    "For non-linear relationships, you can use non-linear mathematical functions to fit the data e.g. polynomial and exponential functions. You'll come across these later. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: As an extra measure, it is also important to check for outliers as the presence of outliers in the data can have a major impact on the model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Normality \n",
    "\n",
    "> The normality assumption states that the **model residuals** should follow a normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the normality assumption talks about the **model residuals** and _not_ about the distributions of the **variables**! In general, data scientists will often check the distributions of the variables as well. Keep in mind that the normality assumption is mandatory for the residuals, and it is useful to check normality of your variables to check for weirdness (more on data distributions later), but OLS works fine for non-normal data distributions in the context of prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The easiest way to check for the normality assumption is with histograms or a Q-Q-Plots.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Heteroscedasticity \n",
    "\n",
    "> _Heteroscedasticity_ (also spelled heteroskedasticity) refers to the circumstance in which the dependent variable is unequal across the range of values of the predictor(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is heteroscedasticity in the data, a scatterplot of these variables will often create a cone-like shape. The scatter of the dependent variable widens or narrows as the value of the independent variable increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of heteroscedasticity is _homoscedasticity_, which indicates that a dependent variable's variability is equal across values of the independent variable. **Homoscedasticity is the third assumption necessary when creating a linear regression model.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is good way to check whether the data are homoscedastic (meaning the residuals are equal across the regression line).  The scatter plots shown here are examples of data that are heteroscedastic (except the plot far right). You can also use significance tests like Breusch-Pagan / Cook-Weisberg test or White general test to detect this phenomenon. If these tests give you a p-value < 0.05, the null hypothesis can rejected, and you can assume the data is heteroscedastic."

    "## Coefficient of Determination\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-Squared\n",
    "> **The $R^2$ or Coefficient of determination is a statistical measure that is used to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "R-Squared uses a so-called \"baseline\" model which is the **worst** model. This baseline model does not make use of any independent variables to predict the value of dependent variable Y. Instead, it uses the **mean** of the observed responses of the dependent variable $y$ and always predicts this mean as the value of $y$ for any value of $x$. Any regression model that we fit is compared to this baseline model to understand its **goodness of fit**. Simply put, R-Squared just explains how good is your model when compared to the baseline model. That's about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating R-squared\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical formula to calculate R-Squared for a linear regression line is in terms of **squared errors** for the fitted model and the baseline model. It's calculated as :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large R^2 = 1- \\dfrac{SS_{RES}}{SS_{TOT}} = \\dfrac{\\sum_i(y_i - \\hat y_i)^2}{\\sum_i(y_i - \\overline y_i)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $SS_{RES}$ (also called RSS) is the **Residual** sum of squared errors of our regression model also known as **$SSE$** (Sum of Squared Errors). $SS_{RES}$ is the squared difference between $y$ and $\\hat y$. For the one highlighted observation in our graph above, the $SS_{RES}$ is denoted by the red arrow. This part of the error is not explained by our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* $SS_{TOT}$ (also called TSS)is the **Total** sum of squared error. $SS_{TOT}$ is the squared difference between $y$ and $\\overline y$. For the one highlighted observation in our graph above, the $SS_{TOT}$ is denoted by the green arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at this, you'll understand that you can interpret R-Squared as \"1 - the proportion of the variance _not_ explained by the model\", which means as much as \"the variation explained by the model\". As a result, you'll want to maximize the R-Squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "For completion, \n",
    "\n",
    "* $SS_{EXP}$ (also called ESS) is the **Explained** sum of squared error. $SS_{EXP}$ is the squared difference between $\\hat y$ and $\\overline y$. For the one highlighted observation in our graph above, the $SS_{EXP}$ is denoted by the blue arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **R-Squared can take value between 0 and 1 where values closer to 0 represent a poor fit and values closer to 1 represent an (almost) perfect fit**"

    "* **Method**: The loss function optimized in the parameter selection process. Least Squares since it picks the parameters that reduce the training error. This is also known as Mean Square Error [MSE].\n",
    "* **No. Observations**: The number of observations used by the model, or size of the training data.\n",
    "* **Degrees of Freedom Residuals**: Degrees of freedom of the residuals, which is the number of observations – number of parameters. Intercept is a parameter. The purpose of Degrees of Freedom is to reflect the impact of descriptive/summarizing statistics in the model, which in regression is the coefficient. Since the observations must \"live up\" to these parameters, they only have so many free observations, and the rest must be reserved to \"live up\" to the parameters' prophecy. Internal mechanism to ensures that there are enough observations to parameters.\n",

    "all of the coefficients smaller in magnitude, closer to zero. Some of the penalties have the property to perform both variable selection (setting some coefficients exactly equal to zero) and shrinking the other coefficients. Ridge and Lasso regression are two examples of penalized estimation. There are multiple advantages to using these methods:\n",

    "- They reduce model complexity\n",
    "- The may prevent from overfitting\n",
    "- Some of them may perform variable selection at the same time (when coefficients are set to 0)\n",

    "Recall that you want to minimize your cost function, so by adding the penalty term $\\lambda$, ridge regression puts a constraint on the coefficients $m$.
